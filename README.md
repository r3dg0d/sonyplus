# What is SonyPlus?

SonyPlus is a Web3 Video Streaming platform utilizing livepeer for p2p movie viewing, video uploading, and livestreaming!

It is at its core a twitch.tv or youtube.com competitor, even competes with disney+ and amazon prime video!

It is in it's early stages of development, and the official web3 version of sonyplus will be available for free!

We will also have a sonyplus subscription service for $10 / mo for premium content, and less ads.

Eventually, we might experiment with a webGL based browser gaming experience too!

Until then, feel free to recommend ideas in the issues tab, or fork this repo / star it and help develop something great!
